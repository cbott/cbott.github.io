        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Native American civil rights movement began in the late 1960&#39s and went into the 1970&#39s, though Native American nationalism had been growing since the 40&#39s. American Indians hoped to gain back land from the U.S. that they had previously owned and to gain cultural freedom.</p>

        <h2>Causes and goals</h2>
        <p>Native Americans had been oppressed for hundreds of years, but the 60&#39s were an important time for a number of reasons. Native Americans were following in the footsteps of the African American movement, but they also had a number of social issues requiring change. Along with having 10 times the average unemployment rate, Native American reservations often had very poor conditions. Historically a lot of unhappiness was caused by the large number of treaties which the U.S. government had ignored.</p>
