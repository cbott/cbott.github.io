        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>The Native American civil rights movement began in the late 1960&#39s and went into the 1970&#39s, though Native American 
            nationalism had been growing since the 40&#39s. <br/>American Indians hoped to gain back land from the U.S. that they had previously 
            owned and to gain cultural freedom. Native spirituality played a large role in the movement too.</p>

        <h2>Causes and goals</h2>
        <p>Native Americans had been oppressed for hundreds of years, but the 60&#39s were an important time for a number of reasons. 
        Native Americans were following in the footsteps of the African American movement, but they also had a number of social issues requiring 
        change. Along with having 10 times the average unemployment rate, Native American reservations often had very poor conditions. 
        Historically Native Americans were upset by the large number of treaties which the U.S. government had ignored.</p>
        <p>These issues resulted in a number of goals that the movement hoped to address.</p>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Recovering land that had been taken by the U.S. government</li>
          <li>Recognition of former treaties by the U.S.</li>
          <li>Native American leaders speaking with congress</li>
          <li>Improving poor living conditions on reservations</li>
          <li>Reducing poverty</li>
          <li>Religious and cultural freedom</li>
        </ul>
