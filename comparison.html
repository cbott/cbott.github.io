            <p>The Native American movement differed in many ways from the African American struggle. 
            The main difference was that Native Americans were often violent in their protests. 
            They also had a much greater struggle in many aspects, as they were the poorest minority group , 
            with 40% of Native Americans below the poverty line. Though the African American civil rights movement 
            fought to gain full citizen&#39s rights for blacks, Native Americans hoped to keep their tribes separate from the U.S. government.</p>
