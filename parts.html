      <h2>Alcatraz</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>One of the most widely known demonstrations of the movement was the Indian occupation of Alcatraz island.
             The government had stopped using the island, so according to a treaty from 1868, the land should be returned to the native people. 
             So in 1969, Native Americans occupied the island. The occupation was also seen by many as a comparison between the living
             conditions at the former prison, and the poor conditions on Indian reservations.</p>

            Examples of the Indian Occupation can still be seen today, like the wall of this building
            on Alcatraz island.

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>The Trail of Broken Treaties was another significant event. Native Americans travelled across the country in the fall of 1972 to protest in Washington D.C., this event was partially sponsored by the AIM. The goals of the march were to raise awareness for the struggle faced by Native Americans and to restore former treaties. In the end, the government agreed to complete further treaty negotiations.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Another major protest occurred in 1973, again led by the AIM. This time, almost 200 armed Native Americans took over
          the town of Wounded Knee. The town was the site of a massacre on Native Americans that occurred 83 years earlier. Though
          the event attracted lots of media coverage, little was actually gained from the excessive violence.</p>
